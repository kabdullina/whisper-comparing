00:10.160 --> 00:17.230
You shout aloud, I can't hear a word you say

00:18.490 --> 00:22.670
I'm talking loud, not saying much

00:26.390 --> 00:32.730
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet

00:34.250 --> 00:38.330
You shoot me down, but I get up

00:44.060 --> 00:49.320
Nothing to lose, far away, far away

00:50.060 --> 00:57.180
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away

00:57.940 --> 01:02.750
Shoot me down, I am tight

01:02.790 --> 01:24.040
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall

01:25.360 --> 01:29.840
Goestown, haunted love

01:33.290 --> 01:39.810
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones

01:41.070 --> 01:45.170
I'm talking loud, not saying much

01:50.480 --> 01:56.190
Nothing to lose, far away, far away

01:56.950 --> 02:04.080
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away

02:04.760 --> 02:07.940
Shoot me down, but I won't fall

02:08.880 --> 02:09.670
I am tight

02:09.750 --> 02:42.830
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall

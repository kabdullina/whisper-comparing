1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,230
You shout aloud, I can't hear a word you say

2
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,670
I'm talking loud, not saying much

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,730
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,330
You shoot me down, but I get up

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,320
Nothing to lose, far away, far away

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:57,180
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away

7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,750
Shoot me down, I am tight

8
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:24,040
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840
Goestown, haunted love

10
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,810
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones

11
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,170
I'm talking loud, not saying much

12
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,190
Nothing to lose, far away, far away

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:04,080
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,940
Shoot me down, but I won't fall

15
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,670
I am tight

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:42,830
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall

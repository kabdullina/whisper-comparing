Pretty girls like Samuel and Shelly and he can handle

00:32.890 --> 00:38.910
Life is anything fair, life is anything fair

00:39.470 --> 00:48.010
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

00:52.140 --> 01:00.970
Just as soon as they turn old, oh, come and sweep them off their feet

01:04.730 --> 01:07.730
It's only making me feel smaller

01:10.830 --> 01:21.480
Oh, won't you lay me, you lay me down

01:22.060 --> 01:27.840
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

01:28.320 --> 01:42.030
Won't you lay me down, lay me down

02:20.690 --> 02:22.870
Thanks to Tom, my fool is right

02:23.640 --> 02:26.400
Long before I see the light

02:41.030 --> 03:00.910
Say hello, but I just can't get enough

03:03.190 --> 03:08.960
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

03:09.580 --> 03:15.500
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

03:16.080 --> 03:21.980
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

03:22.640 --> 03:47.380
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

03:47.920 --> 03:48.100
Won't you lay me down

1
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,070
Pretty girls like Samuel

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,140
Can't share

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,780
And he can't handle

4
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,610
Life is anything but fair

5
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,810
Life is anything but fair

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,680
Just as soon as they turn older

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,870
Come and sweep them off their feet

10
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,330
Only making me feel smaller

11
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,180
So won't you lay me

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,440
Won't you lay me down

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,460
Won't you lay me

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,820
Won't you lay me down

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,990
Won't you lay me down

17
00:01:41,950 --> 00:02:22,870
Makes me tell my foolish friend

18
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,200
Long before I see the light

19
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,770
Sail on by

20
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,900
But I just can't

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,650
Getting home

22
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,550
Won't you lay me

23
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,580
Won't you lay me down

24
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,040
Won't you lay me

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,080
Won't you lay me down

26
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,560
Won't you lay me

27
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,780
Won't you lay me down

28
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Won't you lay me

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:47,240
Won't you lay me down

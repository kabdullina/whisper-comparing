Pretty girls like Samuel
Can't share
And he can't handle
Life is anything but fair
Life is anything but fair
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Just as soon as they turn older
Come and sweep them off their feet
Only making me feel smaller
Oh
So won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me down
Makes me tell my foolish friend
Long before I see the light
Sail on by
But I just can't
Getting home
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down

1
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:32,350
She's a empty canvas on the sheets of clay

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,950
The world lay spread out before me as her body would still

3
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,770
Oh, five horizons revolved around the song

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,100
I see her through the song

5
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,000
Now the air I tasted and breathed

6
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:31,550
There's taking a turn and all I know is she gave me all

7
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:40,830
That she wore out my bitter hands

8
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,070
Shaked beneath the clouds of what was everything

9
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,190
All the pictures said, all been washed in black

10
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,410
Tattooed everything

11
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,860
I take a walk outside

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm surrounded by some kids I've been

13
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,970
I can feel their laughter

14
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,290
So why do I see her?

15
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,230
I'm twisted thoughts that span around my head

16
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,750
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning

17
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,870
How quick the song can drop away

18
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,730
Now my bitter hands

19
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,910
Create a broken glass of what was everything

20
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,930
All the pictures said, all been washed in black

21
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,070
Tattooed everything

22
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,530
All the love gone bad

23
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,570
Turned my world to black

24
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,370
Tattooed all I see

25
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,910
All that I am

26
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,810
All I'll be

27
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,670
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life

28
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,890
I know you'll be a star

29
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,710
Being somebody else's sky

30
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,630
But why?

31
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,210
Why?

32
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,650
Why can't it be?

33
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,810
Or can't it be?

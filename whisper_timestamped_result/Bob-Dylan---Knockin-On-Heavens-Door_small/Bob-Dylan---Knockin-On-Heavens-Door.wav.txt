Mama take this badge off of me
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knocking on Heaven's door
Knock knock knock knock knock
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I'm knocking on Heaven's door
Knock knock knock knock
Knock knock knock knock

1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,340
I follow the Moscow down to Gonkipok listening to the wind of change

2
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:46,850
An august summer night soldiers passing by listening to the wind of change

3
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:21,810
The world is closing in, did you ever think that we could be so close like brothers

4
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:36,050
The futures in the air can feel it everywhere, blowing with the wind of change

5
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:56,440
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

6
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:16,510
Walking down the street, distant memories are buried in the past forever

7
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:31,790
I follow the Moscow down to Gonkipok listening to the wind of change

8
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:51,790
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

9
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:07,320
The wind of change blows straight into the face of time like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell for peace of mind

10
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,920
Lady of Alalaka sing what my guitar wants to sing

11
00:03:47,710 --> 00:04:01,600
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

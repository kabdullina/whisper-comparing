00:22.000 --> 00:32.340
I follow the Moscow down to Gonkipok listening to the wind of change

00:36.310 --> 00:46.850
An august summer night soldiers passing by listening to the wind of change

01:11.070 --> 01:21.810
The world is closing in, did you ever think that we could be so close like brothers

01:25.390 --> 01:36.050
The futures in the air can feel it everywhere, blowing with the wind of change

01:42.030 --> 01:56.440
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

02:06.650 --> 02:16.510
Walking down the street, distant memories are buried in the past forever

02:21.390 --> 02:31.790
I follow the Moscow down to Gonkipok listening to the wind of change

02:37.980 --> 02:51.790
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

02:55.780 --> 03:07.320
The wind of change blows straight into the face of time like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell for peace of mind

03:08.400 --> 03:13.920
Lady of Alalaka sing what my guitar wants to sing

03:47.710 --> 04:01.600
To the magic of the moment, an aglory night where the children of tomorrow be my wings in the wind of change

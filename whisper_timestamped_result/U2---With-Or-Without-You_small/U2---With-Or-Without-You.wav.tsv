28100	35920	See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side.
37080	48890	I'll wait for you, slide of hand and twist of fate.
49570	53170	On the bed of nails she makes me wait.
54470	67940	And I wait without you, with or without you, with or without you.
71720	79480	Through the storm we reach the shore, you give it all but I want more.
80640	122960	And I'm waiting for you, with or without you, with or without you.
132270	140310	My hands are tied, my body bruised, she got me with.
141030	147470	Nothing went and nothing left to lose.
148110	155750	And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away.
156850	201890	And you give yourself away, with or without you.

1
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,920
See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side.

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:48,890
I'll wait for you, slide of hand and twist of fate.

3
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,170
On the bed of nails she makes me wait.

4
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:07,940
And I wait without you, with or without you, with or without you.

5
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,480
Through the storm we reach the shore, you give it all but I want more.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:02:02,960
And I'm waiting for you, with or without you, with or without you.

7
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:20,310
My hands are tied, my body bruised, she got me with.

8
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,470
Nothing went and nothing left to lose.

9
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,750
And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away.

10
00:02:36,850 --> 00:03:21,890
And you give yourself away, with or without you.

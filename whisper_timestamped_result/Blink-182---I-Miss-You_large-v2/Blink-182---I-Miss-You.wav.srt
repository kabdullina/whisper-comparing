00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:22,340
Hello there, the angel from the nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue,

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,050
the unsuspected victim of darkness in the valley.

3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,070
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want, where you can always find me.

4
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,610
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas, and in the night we'll wish this never ends.

5
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,370
We'll wish this never ends.

6
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,120
I miss you, I miss you.

7
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,250
Where are you?

8
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,710
And I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,800
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,820
I need somebody and always.

11
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:28,530
This sick, strange darkness comes creeping on so hot in every time, and as I said I can't

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,280
The webs from all the spiders, catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you.

13
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,590
And hear your voice of treason, will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

14
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,930
Stop this pain tonight.

15
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:07,970
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

16
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:18,410
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

17
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:52,850
And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

18
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,950
And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

19
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,870
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,080
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

21
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:57,370
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

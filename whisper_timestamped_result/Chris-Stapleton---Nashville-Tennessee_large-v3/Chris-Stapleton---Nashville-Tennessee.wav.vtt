00:24.490 --> 00:27.190
I met you when I had a dream

00:28.090 --> 00:30.530
Not so long ago it seems

00:31.070 --> 00:33.610
We closed down a million bars

00:34.230 --> 00:36.770
Yeah, you and me, we've come so far

00:37.370 --> 00:39.990
You showed me how to write a song

00:40.550 --> 00:43.150
We wrote some rite, we wrote some wrong

00:43.450 --> 00:46.250
I was down and out, you let me in

00:46.810 --> 00:49.590
The time she was my only friend

00:52.590 --> 00:54.910
So long nights we were in Tennessee

00:55.930 --> 00:58.410
You can't have what's left of me

00:59.070 --> 01:01.210
And as far as I can tell

01:02.210 --> 01:04.710
That's how time I wish you were

01:04.990 --> 01:07.670
You built me up, you set me free

01:08.410 --> 01:10.730
You tore down my memories

01:11.330 --> 01:14.130
So you be you, now be me

01:14.770 --> 01:17.010
So long nights we were in Tennessee

01:30.770 --> 01:33.470
Now you won't miss me when I'm gone

01:33.910 --> 01:36.610
Your custom made for moving on

01:37.210 --> 01:39.810
And time to time I'll pass you by

01:40.350 --> 01:42.790
A face that I don't recognize

01:43.530 --> 01:46.290
And who knows, maybe it's from now

01:46.290 --> 01:49.170
You'll be the one I think about

01:49.810 --> 01:52.290
But I just can't imagine that

01:52.910 --> 01:55.570
Cause I'm not one for looking back

01:58.650 --> 02:00.930
So long nights we were in Tennessee

02:01.830 --> 02:04.410
You can't have what's left of me

02:04.990 --> 02:07.210
And as far as I can tell

02:08.210 --> 02:10.590
That's how time I wish you were

02:10.590 --> 02:13.610
You built me up, you set me free

02:14.310 --> 02:16.630
You tore down my memories

02:17.230 --> 02:20.030
So you be you, now be me

02:20.610 --> 02:22.850
So long nights we were in Tennessee

02:36.190 --> 02:38.530
So long nights we were in Tennessee

02:39.430 --> 02:42.030
You can't have what's left of me

02:42.650 --> 02:44.790
And as far as I can tell

02:45.750 --> 02:48.270
That's how time I wish you were

02:48.690 --> 02:51.210
You built me up, you set me free

02:51.930 --> 02:54.270
You tore down my memories

02:55.030 --> 02:57.550
You're not who you used to be

02:58.290 --> 03:00.470
So long nights we were in Tennessee

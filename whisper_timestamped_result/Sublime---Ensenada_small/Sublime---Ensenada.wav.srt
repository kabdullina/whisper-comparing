1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,580
It's a test of the ancient firebenders to keep the flame.

2
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,090
I make love to

3
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,630
Dancing out of all my mind

4
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,890
And as the day is long

5
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,250
Something I can promise ya

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,250
That if I was the mother of the president

7
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,910
I'd hire 20 circus for my cabinet

8
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,670
Shot out full of mouths, need not apply

9
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,350
If you never hear another word, you know the reason why

10
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,090
There's something you should know

11
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,850
I declare you're stoked

12
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,650
I don't wanna be your man no more

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,490
I wanna make love to

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,110
Dancing out of all my mind

15
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,750
I don't wanna be your man no more

16
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,610
I wanna make love to

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,170
Dancing out of all my mind

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,040
I don't wanna be your man no more

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,940
I wanna make love to

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,500
Dancing out of all my mind

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,140
I don't wanna be your man no more

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,780
I wanna make love to

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,180
Dancing out of all my mind

24
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,750
There's something you should know

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,260
I declare you're stoked

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,700
There's something you should know

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,330
I declare you're stoked

28
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,670
There's something you should know

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,320
I declare you're stoked

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,800
There's something you should know

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
I declare you're stoked

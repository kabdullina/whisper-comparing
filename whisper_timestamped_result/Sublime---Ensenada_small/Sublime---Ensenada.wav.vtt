00:00.520 --> 00:03.580
It's a test of the ancient firebenders to keep the flame.

00:33.270 --> 00:34.090
I make love to

00:35.030 --> 00:37.630
Dancing out of all my mind

00:50.190 --> 00:51.890
And as the day is long

00:52.610 --> 00:54.250
Something I can promise ya

00:54.530 --> 00:56.250
That if I was the mother of the president

00:57.010 --> 00:58.910
I'd hire 20 circus for my cabinet

00:59.530 --> 01:01.670
Shot out full of mouths, need not apply

01:01.890 --> 01:04.350
If you never hear another word, you know the reason why

01:05.330 --> 01:07.090
There's something you should know

01:08.110 --> 01:09.850
I declare you're stoked

01:10.390 --> 01:12.650
I don't wanna be your man no more

01:13.270 --> 01:14.490
I wanna make love to

01:15.430 --> 01:18.110
Dancing out of all my mind

01:19.210 --> 01:22.750
I don't wanna be your man no more

01:23.170 --> 01:24.610
I wanna make love to

01:25.230 --> 01:28.170
Dancing out of all my mind

01:50.700 --> 01:53.040
I don't wanna be your man no more

01:53.600 --> 01:54.940
I wanna make love to

01:55.900 --> 01:58.500
Dancing out of all my mind

01:59.600 --> 02:03.140
I don't wanna be your man no more

02:03.580 --> 02:05.780
I wanna make love to

02:05.960 --> 02:08.180
Dancing out of all my mind

02:10.930 --> 02:12.750
There's something you should know

02:13.840 --> 02:15.260
I declare you're stoked

02:16.040 --> 02:17.700
There's something you should know

02:18.800 --> 02:20.330
I declare you're stoked

02:21.090 --> 02:22.670
There's something you should know

02:23.850 --> 02:25.320
I declare you're stoked

02:26.120 --> 02:29.800
There's something you should know

02:29.800 --> 02:30.760
I declare you're stoked

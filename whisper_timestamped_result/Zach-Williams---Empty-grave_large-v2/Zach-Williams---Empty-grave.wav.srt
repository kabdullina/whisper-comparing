1
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,000
Wipe away those tears child, there's no need to cry

2
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,060
Stand up on your feet now, lift your head up high

3
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,640
Now wait till tomorrow to lay down your sorrow

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Freedom is here today

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,580
Wipe away those tears child, and put down your shame

6
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,960
Oh, I see L.M.T. Gray

7
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,980
The heavens waking, angels in jubilation

8
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,550
Bad storms beckoning, the darkness breaking

9
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,250
I bet the devil shaking, somebody celebrate

10
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,470
I see L.M.T. Gray

11
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:55,590
Wipe away those tears child, there's no need to cry

12
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,700
Stand up on your feet now, lift your head up high

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Now wait till tomorrow to lay down your sorrow

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,920
Freedom is here today

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,180
Wipe away those tears child, and put down your shame

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,660
Oh, I see L.M.T. Gray

17
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,270
I hear the heavens waking, angels in jubilation

18
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:34,130
Bad storms beckoning, the darkness breaking

19
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,630
I bet the devil shaking, somebody celebrate

20
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,800
I see L.M.T. Gray

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,250
Wipe away those tears child, go and tell the news

22
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,960
What started in the garden was finished in the tomb

23
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,920
It's all reversed, the apple occurs three days in the ground

24
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,300
Christ our Lord is risen, death couldn't hold him down

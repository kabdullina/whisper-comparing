00:05.580 --> 00:07.440
So if you're lonely

00:09.080 --> 00:12.340
You know I'm here waiting for you

00:12.720 --> 00:14.460
I'm just a crosshair

00:15.990 --> 00:19.070
I'm just a shot away from you

00:19.490 --> 00:21.350
And if you leave here

00:22.570 --> 00:25.770
You leave me broken, shattered, and lie

00:26.190 --> 00:27.970
I'm just a crosshair

00:29.430 --> 00:32.690
I'm just a shot, then we can die

00:44.270 --> 00:47.960
Even here, with you

01:23.500 --> 01:26.170
Hey, don't you know you say you

01:27.430 --> 01:33.650
I say, I say you don't show

01:34.230 --> 01:36.050
Don't move, time is slow

01:36.650 --> 01:55.550
I say, you say I say

02:00.090 --> 02:01.230
Move this could die

02:01.790 --> 02:03.630
I smooth this could die

02:04.110 --> 02:08.710
I want you to take me out

02:13.070 --> 02:15.960
I know I hope you're leaving here

02:16.860 --> 02:20.440
Oh, I know I believe in him

02:21.920 --> 02:29.350
I know I believe in him

02:30.230 --> 02:31.290
With you

02:40.850 --> 02:43.390
Hey, don't you know you say you

02:43.390 --> 02:45.570
Don't know I say

02:50.090 --> 02:51.270
In this could die

02:52.300 --> 02:53.650
Take this could die

02:54.130 --> 02:58.580
I want you to take me out

02:58.660 --> 03:00.440
I move this could die

03:01.060 --> 03:02.980
I smooth this could die

03:03.380 --> 03:04.140
Come on

03:28.080 --> 03:29.230
Believe in him

03:30.470 --> 03:33.150
I know I hope you're leaving here

03:34.990 --> 03:38.090
I know I believe in him

03:38.750 --> 03:39.770
With you

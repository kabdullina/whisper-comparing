00:28.100 --> 00:35.920
See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side.

00:37.080 --> 00:48.890
I'll wait for you, slide of hand and twist of fate.

00:49.570 --> 00:53.170
On the bed of nails she makes me wait.

00:54.470 --> 01:07.940
And I wait without you, with or without you, with or without you.

01:11.720 --> 01:19.480
Through the storm we reach the shore, you give it all but I want more.

01:20.640 --> 02:02.960
And I'm waiting for you, with or without you, with or without you.

02:12.270 --> 02:20.310
My hands are tied, my body bruised, she got me with.

02:21.030 --> 02:27.470
Nothing went and nothing left to lose.

02:28.110 --> 02:35.750
And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away.

02:36.850 --> 03:21.890
And you give yourself away, with or without you.

See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side.
I'll wait for you, slide of hand and twist of fate.
On the bed of nails she makes me wait.
And I wait without you, with or without you, with or without you.
Through the storm we reach the shore, you give it all but I want more.
And I'm waiting for you, with or without you, with or without you.
My hands are tied, my body bruised, she got me with.
Nothing went and nothing left to lose.
And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away.
And you give yourself away, with or without you.

Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?

00:44.230 --> 00:52.110
Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fainting smiles, can you feel me?

00:56.100 --> 01:10.880
Hey you, don't help them to bury the line, don't give in without a fight

01:18.540 --> 01:26.200
Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?

01:29.200 --> 01:36.940
Hey you, with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?

01:42.090 --> 01:45.290
Would you help me to carry the stuff?

01:51.310 --> 01:55.700
Open your heart, I'm coming home

02:55.750 --> 03:06.390
But it was only fantasy, the wall was too high as you can see

03:09.980 --> 03:20.360
No matter how he tried, he could not break free, and the worm sat into his brain

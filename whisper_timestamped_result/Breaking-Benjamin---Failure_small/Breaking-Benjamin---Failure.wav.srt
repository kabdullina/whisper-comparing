1
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,670
Life will come our way

2
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,770
It has only just begun

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,010
The world will die a lot

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,900
The fray will fall below

5
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,120
Time will take our place

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,280
We will turn it back to one

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,480
The code for the code

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,460
The long and long road

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,600
Look for the light that leads me

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,770
Tide of a temple

11
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,730
A world down

12
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,230
Temple of a world down

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,680
Of salient

14
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,070
Drive the crowd away

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,690
We will fall from last to none

16
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,870
The dark will fall with a tongue

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,970
The world will carry on

18
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,010
Look for the light that leads me

19
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,930
Tide of feeling lost

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,200
Temple of a world down

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Temple of a world down

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,710
Of stint, red, tidied

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,560
Temple of a world down

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,020
Temple of a world down

25
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,370
Of salient

26
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,370
Tide of a world down

27
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,770
Temple of a world down

28
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,190
Tide of wasted red, tidied

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,000
Temple of a world down

30
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,690
Temple of a world down

31
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,160
The value of sunlight

32
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:19,190
Will fail, will fail

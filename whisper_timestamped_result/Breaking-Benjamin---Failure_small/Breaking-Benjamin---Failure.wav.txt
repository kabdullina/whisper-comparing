Life will come our way
It has only just begun
The world will die a lot
The fray will fall below
Time will take our place
We will turn it back to one
The code for the code
The long and long road
Look for the light that leads me
Tide of a temple
A world down
Temple of a world down
Of salient
Drive the crowd away
We will fall from last to none
The dark will fall with a tongue
The world will carry on
Look for the light that leads me
Tide of feeling lost
Temple of a world down
Temple of a world down
Of stint, red, tidied
Temple of a world down
Temple of a world down
Of salient
Tide of a world down
Temple of a world down
Tide of wasted red, tidied
Temple of a world down
Temple of a world down
The value of sunlight
Will fail, will fail

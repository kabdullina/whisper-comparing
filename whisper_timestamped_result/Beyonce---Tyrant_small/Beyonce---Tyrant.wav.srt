1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,570
Halboy Carter? Time to strike a match and ride up this Duke George.

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,240
I am the one, I am the one now, just tell me how to.

3
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Boy she got that water, think man got that water.

4
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,140
Don't act like you don't know.

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,720
Giddy up, giddy up.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't pay me in gold.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,620
Giddy up, giddy up.

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,720
Back outside, I'm on the road.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,320
Giddy up, giddy up.

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,700
When the sun goes down.

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,380
It's night of night of pain.

12
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,550
You can hear her body howl.

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,160
It's night of pain.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,420
You hear her eye in me like howl.

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm on the side of a patch.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,060
I'll drive your man when a hangman coming down.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,260
She's a tyrant.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,160
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
Make it look so good.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,940
Try to justify it.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,980
Boy you know they're looking for me.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,800
How we gonna hide it?

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,220
Try to look hydraulic.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,500
I am such a tyrant.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,360
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
I don't like to sit up in the saddle.

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,200
Boy I got it.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,100
Just relax, I got this.

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
I got that exotic.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,980
It's so so hypnotic.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,540
I am such a tyrant.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,660
So you with me or not?

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,880
Throw it back.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,040
Shoot up the bar.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,040
To tell a lie we don't remember.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,010
And after that, stop.

37
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,080
Giddy up to me.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,060
At a scene of 5'9".

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,060
To confine what a tragedy.

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,400
Trying to get away.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,320
Riding you while we trying to get your way.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,440
That's so sexy and I know it.

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,280
And I'm afraid to show it.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,180
Baby I'm go-de-baby I'm go-ing.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,360
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the run-run.

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Tie me on the shoulder when you reload the gun.

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,020
Tyrant.

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,080
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,860
Make it look so good.

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,880
Try to justify it.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,920
Boy you know they're looking for me.

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,700
How we gonna hide it?

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,340
Try to look hydraulic.

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,500
You're a tyrant.

55
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,200
Did you get used to the haunting?

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,880
The haunting.

57
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,790
The haunting.

58
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,830
You're just sending me.

59
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,960
She got that water.

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,920
Hangman got that water.

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,640
Don't act like you don't know.

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,940
Giddy up, giddy up.

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,980
Don't pay me in gold.

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,980
Giddy up, giddy up.

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,000
Back outside, I'm on the road.

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,940
Giddy up, giddy up.

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,940
When the sun goes down.

68
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,150
Can't hear this body howl.

69
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,960
Giddy up, giddy up.

70
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't dig a dent.

71
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,940
Can't leave me alone.

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,040
If I do, if I don't.

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:33,940
Okay.

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,520
Tyrant.

75
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,680
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

76
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,100
Make it look so good.

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,460
Try to justify it.

78
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,500
Boy you know they're looking for me.

79
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,280
How we gonna hide it?

80
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,140
Try to look hydraulic.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,080
I am such a tyrant.

82
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,920
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,920
In the end, this will sit up in the snare.

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
Oh boy, I got it.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
Just relax, I got this.

86
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,260
I got that exotic.

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,420
This hip's so hypnotic.

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,240
I am such a tyrant.

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,720
Answer me now.

90
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,580
You owe me a debt.

91
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,480
You stole him from me.

92
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,820
I hate it.

93
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,260
I hate you now.

94
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
Just tell me how.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,360
Tell me how.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,680
I hate it.

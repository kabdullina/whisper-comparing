Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fainting smiles, can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the line, don't give in without a fight
Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?
Would you help me to carry the stuff?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy, the wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free, and the worm sat into his brain

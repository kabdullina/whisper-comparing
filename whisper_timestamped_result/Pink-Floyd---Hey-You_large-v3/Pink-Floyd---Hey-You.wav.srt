00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,320
Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?

2
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:52,110
Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fainting smiles, can you feel me?

3
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:10,880
Hey you, don't help them to bury the line, don't give in without a fight

4
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,200
Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,940
Hey you, with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?

6
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,290
Would you help me to carry the stuff?

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,700
Open your heart, I'm coming home

8
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:06,390
But it was only fantasy, the wall was too high as you can see

9
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:20,360
No matter how he tried, he could not break free, and the worm sat into his brain

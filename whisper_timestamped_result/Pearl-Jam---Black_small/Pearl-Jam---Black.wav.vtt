00:24.210 --> 00:32.350
She's a empty canvas on the sheets of clay

00:36.320 --> 00:44.950
The world lay spread out before me as her body would still

00:50.770 --> 00:57.770
Oh, five horizons revolved around the song

00:59.320 --> 01:01.100
I see her through the song

01:02.220 --> 01:07.000
Now the air I tasted and breathed

01:07.740 --> 01:31.550
There's taking a turn and all I know is she gave me all

01:32.890 --> 01:40.830
That she wore out my bitter hands

01:41.630 --> 01:46.070
Shaked beneath the clouds of what was everything

01:48.190 --> 01:53.190
All the pictures said, all been washed in black

01:54.090 --> 01:55.410
Tattooed everything

01:59.980 --> 02:02.860
I take a walk outside

02:04.360 --> 02:09.020
I'm surrounded by some kids I've been

02:11.370 --> 02:14.970
I can feel their laughter

02:17.070 --> 02:20.290
So why do I see her?

02:25.130 --> 02:31.230
I'm twisted thoughts that span around my head

02:32.790 --> 02:36.750
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning

02:37.170 --> 02:42.870
How quick the song can drop away

02:47.310 --> 02:49.730
Now my bitter hands

02:50.590 --> 02:54.910
Create a broken glass of what was everything

02:56.850 --> 03:01.930
All the pictures said, all been washed in black

03:02.790 --> 03:04.070
Tattooed everything

03:06.130 --> 03:08.530
All the love gone bad

03:09.290 --> 03:11.570
Turned my world to black

03:12.050 --> 03:14.370
Tattooed all I see

03:15.430 --> 03:17.910
All that I am

03:18.550 --> 03:19.810
All I'll be

03:38.160 --> 03:40.670
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life

03:41.010 --> 03:42.890
I know you'll be a star

03:43.790 --> 03:46.710
Being somebody else's sky

03:47.070 --> 03:47.630
But why?

03:49.010 --> 03:49.210
Why?

03:52.330 --> 03:53.650
Why can't it be?

03:54.430 --> 03:55.810
Or can't it be?

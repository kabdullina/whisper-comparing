She's a empty canvas on the sheets of clay,24.21,32.35
The world lay spread out before me as her body would still,36.32,44.95
"Oh, five horizons revolved around the song",50.77,57.77
I see her through the song,59.32,61.1
Now the air I tasted and breathed,62.22,67.0
There's taking a turn and all I know is she gave me all,67.74,91.55
That she wore out my bitter hands,92.89,100.83
Shaked beneath the clouds of what was everything,101.63,106.07
"All the pictures said, all been washed in black",108.19,113.19
Tattooed everything,114.09,115.41
I take a walk outside,119.98,122.86
I'm surrounded by some kids I've been,124.36,129.02
I can feel their laughter,131.37,134.97
So why do I see her?,137.07,140.29
I'm twisted thoughts that span around my head,145.13,151.23
"I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning",152.79,156.75
How quick the song can drop away,157.17,162.87
Now my bitter hands,167.31,169.73
Create a broken glass of what was everything,170.59,174.91
"All the pictures said, all been washed in black",176.85,181.93
Tattooed everything,182.79,184.07
All the love gone bad,186.13,188.53
Turned my world to black,189.29,191.57
Tattooed all I see,192.05,194.37
All that I am,195.43,197.91
All I'll be,198.55,199.81
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,218.16,220.67
I know you'll be a star,221.01,222.89
Being somebody else's sky,223.79,226.71
But why?,227.07,227.63
Why?,229.01,229.21
Why can't it be?,232.33,233.65
Or can't it be?,234.43,235.81

24210	32350	She's a empty canvas on the sheets of clay
36320	44950	The world lay spread out before me as her body would still
50770	57770	Oh, five horizons revolved around the song
59320	61100	I see her through the song
62220	67000	Now the air I tasted and breathed
67740	91550	There's taking a turn and all I know is she gave me all
92890	100830	That she wore out my bitter hands
101630	106070	Shaked beneath the clouds of what was everything
108190	113190	All the pictures said, all been washed in black
114090	115410	Tattooed everything
119980	122860	I take a walk outside
124360	129020	I'm surrounded by some kids I've been
131370	134970	I can feel their laughter
137070	140290	So why do I see her?
145130	151230	I'm twisted thoughts that span around my head
152790	156750	I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
157170	162870	How quick the song can drop away
167310	169730	Now my bitter hands
170590	174910	Create a broken glass of what was everything
176850	181930	All the pictures said, all been washed in black
182790	184070	Tattooed everything
186130	188530	All the love gone bad
189290	191570	Turned my world to black
192050	194370	Tattooed all I see
195430	197910	All that I am
198550	199810	All I'll be
218160	220670	I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
221010	222890	I know you'll be a star
223790	226710	Being somebody else's sky
227070	227630	But why?
229010	229210	Why?
232330	233650	Why can't it be?
234430	235810	Or can't it be?

00:26.130 --> 00:40.610
I'm singing into my fire

00:48.720 --> 00:54.820
Oh, all flowers in time Bend towards the sun

00:55.380 --> 01:00.380
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

01:01.750 --> 01:06.550
Oh, flowers in time Bend towards the sun

01:07.130 --> 01:12.170
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

01:13.790 --> 01:15.330
But here is one

02:08.270 --> 02:13.150
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

02:17.500 --> 02:22.800
Bend towards the sun I know you say that there's no one for you

02:23.480 --> 02:24.840
But here is one

02:52.340 --> 02:57.020
Keep it going in me We can travel and

02:58.100 --> 03:04.760
Fading farther from me With your face in my window glow

03:08.590 --> 03:31.440
Wait for me, sweet widow It's okay to be in vain

03:32.120 --> 04:36.560
To me, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

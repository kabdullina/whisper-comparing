00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:40,610
I'm singing into my fire

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,820
Oh, all flowers in time Bend towards the sun

3
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,380
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,550
Oh, flowers in time Bend towards the sun

5
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,170
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

6
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,330
But here is one

7
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,150
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,800
Bend towards the sun I know you say that there's no one for you

9
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,840
But here is one

10
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,020
Keep it going in me We can travel and

11
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,760
Fading farther from me With your face in my window glow

12
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:31,440
Wait for me, sweet widow It's okay to be in vain

13
00:03:32,120 --> 00:04:36,560
To me, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

Pretty girls like Samuel and Shelly and he can handle
Life is anything fair, life is anything fair
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just as soon as they turn old, oh, come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
Oh, won't you lay me, you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down
Thanks to Tom, my fool is right
Long before I see the light
Say hello, but I just can't get enough
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me down

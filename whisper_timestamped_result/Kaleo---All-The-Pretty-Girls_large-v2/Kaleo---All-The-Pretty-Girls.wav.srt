00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:29,900
Pretty girls like Samuel and Shelly and he can handle

2
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,910
Life is anything fair, life is anything fair

3
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:48,010
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

4
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,970
Just as soon as they turn old, oh, come and sweep them off their feet

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,730
It's only making me feel smaller

6
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:21,480
Oh, won't you lay me, you lay me down

7
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,840
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:42,030
Won't you lay me down, lay me down

9
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,870
Thanks to Tom, my fool is right

10
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,400
Long before I see the light

11
00:02:41,030 --> 00:03:00,910
Say hello, but I just can't get enough

12
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,960
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

13
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,500
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,980
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

15
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:47,380
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

16
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,100
Won't you lay me down

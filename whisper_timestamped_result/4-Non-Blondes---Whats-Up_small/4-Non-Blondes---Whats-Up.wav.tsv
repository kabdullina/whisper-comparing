29880	40230	25 years and my life is still trying to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.
43700	51300	I realized quickly when I knew I should that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man

57610	64730	In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head
64830	69360	and I, I didn't feel any, a little peculiar.

99740	108360	In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.
171770	178730	In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head

199330	207970	In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.
213460	222120	In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.
223830	225130	What's going on?
227590	243330	In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.
272720	285340	25 years and my life is still done to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:40,230
25 years and my life is still trying to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.

2
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,300
I realized quickly when I knew I should that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,860
for whatever that means.

4
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:04,730
In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head

5
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,360
and I, I didn't feel any, a little peculiar.

6
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:19,130
In Sui wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high

7
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,290
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,170
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

9
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:48,360
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

10
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,730
In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head

11
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,310
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

12
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,900
In Sui wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high

13
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,060
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

14
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:27,970
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

15
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,120
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

16
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,130
What's going on?

17
00:03:47,590 --> 00:04:03,330
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

18
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:45,340
25 years and my life is still done to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.

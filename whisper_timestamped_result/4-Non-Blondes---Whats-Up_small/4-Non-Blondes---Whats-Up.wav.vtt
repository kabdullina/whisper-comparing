00:29.880 --> 00:40.230
25 years and my life is still trying to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.

00:43.700 --> 00:51.300
I realized quickly when I knew I should that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man

00:52.880 --> 00:54.860
for whatever that means.

00:57.610 --> 01:04.730
In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head

01:04.830 --> 01:09.360
and I, I didn't feel any, a little peculiar.

01:11.890 --> 01:19.130
In Sui wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high

01:19.190 --> 01:22.290
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

01:25.600 --> 01:34.170
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

01:39.740 --> 01:48.360
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

02:51.770 --> 02:58.730
In Sui Christ sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head

03:02.930 --> 03:04.310
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

03:07.550 --> 03:12.900
In Sui wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high

03:12.940 --> 03:16.060
and I scream for the top of my lungs what?

03:19.330 --> 03:27.970
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

03:33.460 --> 03:42.120
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.130
What's going on?

03:47.590 --> 04:03.330
In I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey.

04:32.720 --> 04:45.340
25 years and my life is still done to get up that great big healer of hope for a destination.

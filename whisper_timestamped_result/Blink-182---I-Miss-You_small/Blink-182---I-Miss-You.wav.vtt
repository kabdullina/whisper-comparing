Hello there, the angel from the nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue,

00:23.100 --> 00:29.050
the unsuspected victim of darkness in the valley.

00:29.550 --> 00:36.070
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want, where you can always find me.

00:37.230 --> 00:43.610
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas, and in the night we'll wish this never ends.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.370
We'll wish this never ends.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.120
I miss you, I miss you.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.250
Where are you?

01:07.310 --> 01:09.710
And I'm so sorry.

01:11.540 --> 01:14.800
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.820
I need somebody and always.

01:19.210 --> 01:28.530
This sick, strange darkness comes creeping on so hot in every time, and as I said I can't

01:30.400 --> 01:39.280
The webs from all the spiders, catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you.

01:41.030 --> 01:46.590
And hear your voice of treason, will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

01:47.710 --> 01:49.930
Stop this pain tonight.

01:59.530 --> 02:07.970
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

02:10.130 --> 02:18.410
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

02:44.730 --> 02:52.850
And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

02:54.690 --> 03:02.950
And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

03:04.850 --> 03:12.870
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.080
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.

03:35.440 --> 03:57.370
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

13620	22340	Hello there, the angel from the nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue,
23100	29050	the unsuspected victim of darkness in the valley.
29550	36070	We can live like Jack and Sally if we want, where you can always find me.
37230	43610	And we'll have Halloween on Christmas, and in the night we'll wish this never ends.
44750	46370	We'll wish this never ends.
54900	57120	I miss you, I miss you.
66210	67250	Where are you?
67310	69710	And I'm so sorry.
71540	74800	I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight.
75600	77820	I need somebody and always.
79210	88530	This sick, strange darkness comes creeping on so hot in every time, and as I said I can't
90400	99280	The webs from all the spiders, catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you.
101030	106590	And hear your voice of treason, will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
107710	109930	Stop this pain tonight.
119530	127970	Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
130130	138410	Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
164730	172850	And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
174690	182950	And don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
184850	192870	Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
195000	203080	Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
215440	237370	I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

12130	15290	I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
17730	21130	Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
24130	26170	And if it was an open shut case
27010	29550	I never would've known from that look on your face
29990	33230	Lost in your current like a priceless wine
35510	38030	The more that you say, the less I know
38450	40610	Wherever you stray, I follow
41290	43870	I'm begging for you to take my hand
44010	46770	Ripped my plans, that's my man
47770	51010	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
53530	57430	Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in
59840	61800	As if you were a mythical thing
62780	65180	Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
65600	68640	There was one prize I'd cheat to win
71230	73730	The more that you say, the less I know
74170	76570	Wherever you stray, I follow
76730	79610	I'm begging for you to take my hand
79970	82510	Ripped my plans, that's my man
82690	85330	You know that my train could take you home
85690	87730	Anywhere else is hollow
88450	91050	I'm begging for you to take my hand
91350	94050	Ripped my plans, that's my man
97730	101290	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
103800	106500	They count me out time and time again
109140	112580	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
115170	118210	I come back stronger than a 90's trend
119170	122570	Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
124860	128860	Show me the places where the others gave you scars
131300	133320	Now this is an open shut case
134160	136740	I guess I should have known from that look on your face
137140	140560	Every bit and switch was a work of art
142670	145250	The more that you say, the less I know
145510	147630	Wherever you stray, I follow
148420	151080	I'm begging for you to take my hand
151420	153940	Ripped my plans, that's my man
154380	156740	You know that my train could take you home
157380	159420	Anywhere else is hollow
160380	162500	I'm begging for you to take my hand
163380	165400	Ripped my plans, that's my man
166380	168120	The more that you say, the less I know
169880	173920	I follow, begging for you to take my hand
174280	176780	Ripped my plans, that's my man
177020	179600	You know that my train could take you home
179980	182280	Anywhere else is hollow
182800	185360	I'm begging for you to take my hand
185620	188360	Ripped my plans, that's my man
189610	191090	Hey, that's my man
192730	193850	That's my man
195540	196680	That's my man
197340	199780	Every bit and switch was a work of art
199980	201200	That's my man
202490	203970	Hey, that's my man
205570	208210	I'm begging for you to take my hand
208530	211290	Ripped my plans, that's my man

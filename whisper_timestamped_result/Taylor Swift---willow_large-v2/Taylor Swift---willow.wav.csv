I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,12.13,15.29
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife,17.73,21.13
And if it was an open shut case,24.13,26.17
I never would've known from that look on your face,27.01,29.55
Lost in your current like a priceless wine,29.99,33.23
"The more that you say, the less I know",35.51,38.03
"Wherever you stray, I follow",38.45,40.61
I'm begging for you to take my hand,41.29,43.87
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",44.01,46.77
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,47.77,51.01
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in,53.53,57.43
As if you were a mythical thing,59.84,61.8
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,62.78,65.18
There was one prize I'd cheat to win,65.6,68.64
"The more that you say, the less I know",71.23,73.73
"Wherever you stray, I follow",74.17,76.57
I'm begging for you to take my hand,76.73,79.61
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",79.97,82.51
You know that my train could take you home,82.69,85.33
Anywhere else is hollow,85.69,87.73
I'm begging for you to take my hand,88.45,91.05
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",91.35,94.05
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,97.73,101.29
They count me out time and time again,103.8,106.5
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,109.14,112.58
I come back stronger than a 90's trend,115.17,118.21
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark,119.17,122.57
Show me the places where the others gave you scars,124.86,128.86
Now this is an open shut case,131.3,133.32
I guess I should have known from that look on your face,134.16,136.74
Every bit and switch was a work of art,137.14,140.56
"The more that you say, the less I know",142.67,145.25
"Wherever you stray, I follow",145.51,147.63
I'm begging for you to take my hand,148.42,151.08
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",151.42,153.94
You know that my train could take you home,154.38,156.74
Anywhere else is hollow,157.38,159.42
I'm begging for you to take my hand,160.38,162.5
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",163.38,165.4
"The more that you say, the less I know",166.38,168.12
"I follow, begging for you to take my hand",169.88,173.92
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",174.28,176.78
You know that my train could take you home,177.02,179.6
Anywhere else is hollow,179.98,182.28
I'm begging for you to take my hand,182.8,185.36
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",185.62,188.36
"Hey, that's my man",189.61,191.09
That's my man,192.73,193.85
That's my man,195.54,196.68
Every bit and switch was a work of art,197.34,199.78
That's my man,199.98,201.2
"Hey, that's my man",202.49,203.97
I'm begging for you to take my hand,205.57,208.21
"Ripped my plans, that's my man",208.53,211.29

00:17.780 --> 00:24.200
I told you about living in the US of hate, don't you know that I'm a gangster of love?

00:25.850 --> 00:32.630
Let me tell you people that I found a new way, and I'm tired of all this talk about love.

00:33.450 --> 00:40.230
In the same old story, we were going to settle words about the good and the bad and the poor.

00:41.470 --> 00:48.530
And the times keep on changing so I'm keeping on top of every fat gap who walks through my door.

00:49.470 --> 00:56.390
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

00:57.630 --> 01:06.510
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33.010 --> 01:39.490
I was born on this rock and I've been traveling through space since the moment I first realized

01:40.710 --> 01:47.330
what all you fast-talking cats would do if you could. You know I'm ready for the final surprise.

01:48.710 --> 01:55.390
There ain't no way around it, ain't nothing to say that's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside.

01:56.510 --> 02:03.210
All the prayers and sobares keep the whole place uptight, love it keeps on getting darker outside.

02:04.430 --> 02:11.330
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

02:12.330 --> 02:21.150
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44.030 --> 03:50.710
I've seen your showdown, slowdowns, lost and found, turn around, support and on military shirts.

03:51.830 --> 03:58.570
I keep my eyes on the prize on the long-thoughtened skies and I don't let my friends get hurt.

03:59.630 --> 04:06.190
All you black-roofed schemers, power-tripped dreamers, better find something new to say.

04:07.390 --> 04:14.190
Cause you're the same old story, it's the same old crime, you've got some heavy dudes to pay.

04:15.270 --> 04:22.010
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

04:23.170 --> 04:31.970
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

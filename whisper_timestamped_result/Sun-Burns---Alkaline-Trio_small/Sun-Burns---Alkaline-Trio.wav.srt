1
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,110
Came up to the surface I cannot remember

2
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,070
How long I've been swimming, drowning

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,210
Gets out grown accustomed to all of the sharks

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,310
And we're not really breathing

5
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,590
Now I won't just mind the gap I'll fill it

6
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,170
If I'm gonna eat this mosquito I'll have to thank it

7
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,710
I haven't really made the most of this life

8
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,370
From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right

9
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,750
One time I told my heart to shut up

10
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,590
But I know that I can't win back her to us

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,650
I don't at least add much to the both of us

12
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,620
To fell out the neck for this dull conversation

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,780
I'd shop in my whip But what's my motivation

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,420
Don't need to be clever to tell you that I'm just

15
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
A total mess and then I must throw that old self away

16
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,090
If I don't get right now I will always

17
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,050
Eat what's to gain, sleep with the snakes

18
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,430
Here in this cold grave

19
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,210
I haven't really made the most of this life

20
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,750
From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right

21
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,190
One time I told my heart to shut up

22
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,070
But I know that I can't win back her to us

23
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,910
I don't at least add much to the both of us

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,600
I was waiting for this to happen to me

25
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,210
But nothing's happening

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,880
I feel my skin as the sun burns it

27
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,020
And something in me sets light on it

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,460
Cause one more look might change it all

29
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,370
One more word might change it all

30
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,610
One more try might change it all

31
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,390
One more try might change it all

32
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,970
One more look might change it all

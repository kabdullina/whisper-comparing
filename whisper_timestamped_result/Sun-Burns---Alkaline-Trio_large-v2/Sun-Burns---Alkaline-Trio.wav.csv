Came up to the surface I cannot remember,14.19,17.11
"How long I've been swimming, drowning",18.61,23.07
Gets out grown accustomed to all of the sharks,26.27,29.21
And we're not really breathing,30.49,32.31
Now I won't just mind the gap I'll fill it,34.41,41.59
If I'm gonna eat this mosquito I'll have to thank it,42.91,48.17
I haven't really made the most of this life,49.13,54.71
From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right,55.01,59.37
One time I told my heart to shut up,60.61,65.75
But I know that I can't win back her to us,66.99,71.59
I don't at least add much to the both of us,73.07,78.65
To fell out the neck for this dull conversation,92.7,95.62
I'd shop in my whip But what's my motivation,97.0,101.78
Don't need to be clever to tell you that I'm just,104.72,108.42
A total mess and then I must throw that old self away,108.96,113.6
If I don't get right now I will always,115.33,120.09
"Eat what's to gain, sleep with the snakes",121.55,124.05
Here in this cold grave,124.59,126.43
I haven't really made the most of this life,127.61,133.21
From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right,133.51,137.75
One time I told my heart to shut up,139.11,144.19
But I know that I can't win back her to us,145.51,150.07
I don't at least add much to the both of us,151.51,156.91
I was waiting for this to happen to me,159.12,164.6
But nothing's happening,166.21,168.21
I feel my skin as the sun burns it,171.24,176.88
And something in me sets light on it,177.72,180.02
Cause one more look might change it all,180.72,183.46
One more word might change it all,186.71,189.37
One more try might change it all,192.77,195.61
One more try might change it all,198.81,201.39
One more look might change it all,204.89,207.97

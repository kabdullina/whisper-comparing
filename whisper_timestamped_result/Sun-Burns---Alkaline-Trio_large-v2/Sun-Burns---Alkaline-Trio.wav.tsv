14190	17110	Came up to the surface I cannot remember
18610	23070	How long I've been swimming, drowning
26270	29210	Gets out grown accustomed to all of the sharks
30490	32310	And we're not really breathing
34410	41590	Now I won't just mind the gap I'll fill it
42910	48170	If I'm gonna eat this mosquito I'll have to thank it
49130	54710	I haven't really made the most of this life
55010	59370	From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right
60610	65750	One time I told my heart to shut up
66990	71590	But I know that I can't win back her to us
73070	78650	I don't at least add much to the both of us
92700	95620	To fell out the neck for this dull conversation
97000	101780	I'd shop in my whip But what's my motivation
104720	108420	Don't need to be clever to tell you that I'm just
108960	113600	A total mess and then I must throw that old self away
115330	120090	If I don't get right now I will always
121550	124050	Eat what's to gain, sleep with the snakes
124590	126430	Here in this cold grave
127610	133210	I haven't really made the most of this life
133510	137750	From your honest bed back Whatever don't taste right
139110	144190	One time I told my heart to shut up
145510	150070	But I know that I can't win back her to us
151510	156910	I don't at least add much to the both of us
159120	164600	I was waiting for this to happen to me
166210	168210	But nothing's happening
171240	176880	I feel my skin as the sun burns it
177720	180020	And something in me sets light on it
180720	183460	Cause one more look might change it all
186710	189370	One more word might change it all
192770	195610	One more try might change it all
198810	201390	One more try might change it all
204890	207970	One more look might change it all

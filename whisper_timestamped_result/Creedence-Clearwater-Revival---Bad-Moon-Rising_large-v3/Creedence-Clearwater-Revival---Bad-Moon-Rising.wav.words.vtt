on

00:13.410 --> 00:13.690
the

00:13.690 --> 00:14.030
way.

00:17.780 --> 00:18.080
There

00:18.080 --> 00:18.260
are

00:18.260 --> 00:18.660
wakes

00:18.660 --> 00:18.940
and

00:18.940 --> 00:19.440
lightning.

00:21.790 --> 00:22.010
I

00:22.010 --> 00:22.510

00:29.280 --> 00:29.460
but

00:29.460 --> 00:29.660
let's

00:29.660 --> 00:30.140

00:30.140 --> 00:30.540
take

00:30.540 --> 00:30.840
your

00:30.840 --> 00:31.340
life.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.480
There's

00:33.480 --> 00:33.600

00:38.490 --> 00:39.690

00:39.690 --> 00:40.710

00:43.050 --> 00:43.310
I

00:43.310 --> 00:43.730
know

00:43.730 --> 00:44.330
the

00:44.330 --> 00:44.670

00:44.670 --> 00:44.990

00:44.990 --> 00:45.390

00:45.390 --> 00:45.950

00:48.420 --> 00:48.700
I

00:48.700 --> 00:49.160

00:49.160 --> 00:50.100
rivers

00:50.100 --> 00:51.460

00:53.730 --> 00:54.030
I

00:54.030 --> 00:54.590
hear

00:54.590 --> 00:54.930
the

00:54.930 --> 00:55.290

00:55.630 --> 00:55.970
rain

00:55.970 --> 00:56.210
is

00:56.210 --> 00:56.670

00:59.060 --> 00:59.440
Don't

00:59.440 --> 00:59.760

01:00.060 --> 01:00.660

01:01.500 --> 01:01.800

01:02.200 --> 01:02.580

01:02.580 --> 01:02.920
your

01:02.920 --> 01:03.480
life.

01:04.460 --> 01:05.540
There's

01:05.540 --> 01:05.680

01:06.340 --> 01:06.780
on

01:06.780 --> 01:07.080
the

01:07.080 --> 01:07.460
right.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.180
Oh,

01:09.460 --> 01:09.580
right.

01:31.060 --> 01:31.380
Hope

01:31.380 --> 01:31.800

01:32.920 --> 01:33.420
things

01:33.420 --> 01:34.020
together.

01:36.500 --> 01:36.760
Hope

01:36.760 --> 01:37.200
you

01:37.200 --> 01:37.680

01:38.040 --> 01:38.260
the

01:38.260 --> 01:38.720
bad

01:38.720 --> 01:39.340
day.

01:41.690 --> 01:42.050
Looks

01:42.050 --> 01:42.590
like

01:42.590 --> 01:43.170
we're

01:43.170 --> 01:43.410

01:43.670 --> 01:44.150
NASA

01:44.150 --> 01:44.790

01:47.060 --> 01:47.420
One

01:47.420 --> 01:47.840
eye

01:47.840 --> 01:48.460
is

01:48.460 --> 01:48.840

01:48.840 --> 01:49.480
before

01:49.480 --> 01:49.860
an

01:49.860 --> 01:50.080

01:51.670 --> 01:52.290
Well,

01:52.450 --> 01:52.870

01:54.810 --> 01:54.910
but

01:54.910 --> 01:55.130
it's

01:55.130 --> 01:55.510

01:57.850 --> 01:58.930
There's

01:58.930 --> 01:59.070
a

01:59.070 --> 01:59.350

02:03.790 --> 02:03.980
Well,

02:04.120 --> 02:04.280
don't

02:04.280 --> 02:04.300

02:04.320 --> 02:04.720
tonight,

02:05.520 --> 02:05.620
but

02:05.620 --> 02:05.880
it's

02:05.880 --> 02:06.180
time

02:06.180 --> 02:06.480

02:06.480 --> 02:06.740
take

02:06.740 --> 02:07.040

02:08.560 --> 02:09.660
There's

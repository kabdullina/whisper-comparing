1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:14,030
I see bad moon rising, trouble on the way.

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,440
There are wakes and lightning.

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,670
I see bad times today.

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,340
Don't go around tonight, but let's finally take your life.

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,400
There's a bad moon on the right.

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,710
I hear hurricanes blowing.

7
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,950
I know the end is coming soon.

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,460
I hear rivers overflowing.

9
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,670
I hear the voice of rain is growing.

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,480
Don't go around tonight, but let's finally take your life.

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,460
There's a bad moon on the right.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,580
Oh, right.

13
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,020
Hope you got your things together.

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,340
Hope you got quite the bad day.

15
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,790
Looks like we're in for NASA weather.

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,080
One eye is taken before an eye.

17
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,810
Well, don't go around tonight, but it's time to take your life.

18
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,890
There's a bad moon on the right.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,540
Well, don't go around tonight, but it's time to take your life.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,620
There's a bad moon on the right.

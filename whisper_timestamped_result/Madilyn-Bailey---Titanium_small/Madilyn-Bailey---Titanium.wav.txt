You shout aloud, I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up
Nothing to lose, far away, far away
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away
Shoot me down, I am tight
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall
Goestown, haunted love
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much
Nothing to lose, far away, far away
Ricochet, take your aim, far away, far away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am tight
Cut me down, but it's you who have further to fall

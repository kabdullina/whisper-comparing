00:07.110 --> 00:12.570
Halboy Carter? Time to strike a match and ride up this Duke George.

00:37.300 --> 00:42.240
I am the one, I am the one now, just tell me how to.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.400
Boy she got that water, think man got that water.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.140
Don't act like you don't know.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.720
Giddy up, giddy up.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.000
Don't pay me in gold.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.620
Giddy up, giddy up.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.720
Back outside, I'm on the road.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.320
Giddy up, giddy up.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.700
When the sun goes down.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.380
It's night of night of pain.

01:11.620 --> 01:13.550
You can hear her body howl.

01:13.550 --> 01:15.160
It's night of pain.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.420
You hear her eye in me like howl.

01:17.420 --> 01:18.980
I'm on the side of a patch.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.060
I'll drive your man when a hangman coming down.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.260
She's a tyrant.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.160
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.840
Make it look so good.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.940
Try to justify it.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.980
Boy you know they're looking for me.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.800
How we gonna hide it?

01:35.040 --> 01:36.220
Try to look hydraulic.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.500
I am such a tyrant.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.360
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.680
I don't like to sit up in the saddle.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.200
Boy I got it.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.100
Just relax, I got this.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.720
I got that exotic.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.980
It's so so hypnotic.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.540
I am such a tyrant.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.660
So you with me or not?

01:56.300 --> 01:56.880
Throw it back.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.040
Shoot up the bar.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.040
To tell a lie we don't remember.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.010
And after that, stop.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.080
Giddy up to me.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.060
At a scene of 5'9".

02:09.760 --> 02:11.060
To confine what a tragedy.

02:11.060 --> 02:11.400
Trying to get away.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.320
Riding you while we trying to get your way.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.440
That's so sexy and I know it.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.280
And I'm afraid to show it.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.180
Baby I'm go-de-baby I'm go-ing.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.360
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the run-run.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.360
Tie me on the shoulder when you reload the gun.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.020
Tyrant.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.080
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.860
Make it look so good.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.880
Try to justify it.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.920
Boy you know they're looking for me.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.700
How we gonna hide it?

02:36.040 --> 02:37.340
Try to look hydraulic.

02:38.540 --> 02:39.500
You're a tyrant.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.200
Did you get used to the haunting?

02:42.540 --> 02:43.880
The haunting.

02:45.990 --> 02:46.790
The haunting.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.830
You're just sending me.

03:02.940 --> 03:03.960
She got that water.

03:04.940 --> 03:05.920
Hangman got that water.

03:06.940 --> 03:07.640
Don't act like you don't know.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.940
Giddy up, giddy up.

03:11.940 --> 03:13.980
Don't pay me in gold.

03:15.140 --> 03:15.980
Giddy up, giddy up.

03:15.980 --> 03:18.000
Back outside, I'm on the road.

03:19.060 --> 03:19.940
Giddy up, giddy up.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.940
When the sun goes down.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.150
Can't hear this body howl.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.960
Giddy up, giddy up.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.080
Don't dig a dent.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.940
Can't leave me alone.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.040
If I do, if I don't.

03:33.920 --> 03:33.940
Okay.

03:33.940 --> 03:34.520
Tyrant.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.680
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.100
Make it look so good.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.460
Try to justify it.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.500
Boy you know they're looking for me.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.280
How we gonna hide it?

03:44.940 --> 03:46.140
Try to look hydraulic.

03:46.940 --> 03:48.080
I am such a tyrant.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.920
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.920
In the end, this will sit up in the snare.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.700
Oh boy, I got it.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.560
Just relax, I got this.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.260
I got that exotic.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.420
This hip's so hypnotic.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.240
I am such a tyrant.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.720
Answer me now.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.580
You owe me a debt.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.480
You stole him from me.

04:09.740 --> 04:10.820
I hate it.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.260
I hate you now.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.240
Just tell me how.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.360
Tell me how.

04:17.600 --> 04:17.680
I hate it.

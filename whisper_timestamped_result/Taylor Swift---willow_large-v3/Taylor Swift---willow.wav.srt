1
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,290
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,130
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,170
And if it was an open shut case

4
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,550
I never would've known from that look on your face

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,230
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

6
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,030
The more that you say, the less I know

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,610
Wherever you stray, I follow

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,870
I'm begging for you to take my hand

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,770
Ripped my plans, that's my man

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,010
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

11
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,430
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,800
As if you were a mythical thing

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,180
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
There was one prize I'd cheat to win

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,730
The more that you say, the less I know

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,570
Wherever you stray, I follow

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,610
I'm begging for you to take my hand

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,510
Ripped my plans, that's my man

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,330
You know that my train could take you home

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,730
Anywhere else is hollow

21
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,050
I'm begging for you to take my hand

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,050
Ripped my plans, that's my man

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,290
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,500
They count me out time and time again

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,580
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,210
I come back stronger than a 90's trend

27
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,570
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,320
Now this is an open shut case

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,740
I guess I should have known from that look on your face

31
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,560
Every bit and switch was a work of art

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,250
The more that you say, the less I know

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,630
Wherever you stray, I follow

34
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm begging for you to take my hand

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,940
Ripped my plans, that's my man

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,740
You know that my train could take you home

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,420
Anywhere else is hollow

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm begging for you to take my hand

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,400
Ripped my plans, that's my man

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,120
The more that you say, the less I know

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,920
I follow, begging for you to take my hand

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,780
Ripped my plans, that's my man

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,600
You know that my train could take you home

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,280
Anywhere else is hollow

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm begging for you to take my hand

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,360
Ripped my plans, that's my man

47
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,090
Hey, that's my man

48
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,850
That's my man

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,680
That's my man

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,780
Every bit and switch was a work of art

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,200
That's my man

52
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,970
Hey, that's my man

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,210
I'm begging for you to take my hand

54
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,290
Ripped my plans, that's my man

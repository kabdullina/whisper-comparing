17780	24200	I told you about living in the US of hate, don't you know that I'm a gangster of love?
25850	32630	Let me tell you people that I found a new way, and I'm tired of all this talk about love.
33450	40230	In the same old story, we were going to settle words about the good and the bad and the poor.
41470	48530	And the times keep on changing so I'm keeping on top of every fat gap who walks through my door.
49470	56390	I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.
57630	66510	I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
93010	99490	I was born on this rock and I've been traveling through space since the moment I first realized
100710	107330	what all you fast-talking cats would do if you could. You know I'm ready for the final surprise.
108710	115390	There ain't no way around it, ain't nothing to say that's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside.
116510	123210	All the prayers and sobares keep the whole place uptight, love it keeps on getting darker outside.

224030	230710	I've seen your showdown, slowdowns, lost and found, turn around, support and on military shirts.
231830	238570	I keep my eyes on the prize on the long-thoughtened skies and I don't let my friends get hurt.
239630	246190	All you black-roofed schemers, power-tripped dreamers, better find something new to say.
247390	254190	Cause you're the same old story, it's the same old crime, you've got some heavy dudes to pay.
255270	262010	I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.
263170	271970	I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

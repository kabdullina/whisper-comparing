I'm singing into my fire,26.13,40.61
"Oh, all flowers in time Bend towards the sun",48.72,54.82
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one,55.38,60.38
"Oh, flowers in time Bend towards the sun",61.75,66.55
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one,67.13,72.17
But here is one,73.79,75.33
I know you say that there's no one for you But here is one,128.27,133.15
Bend towards the sun I know you say that there's no one for you,137.5,142.8

Fading farther from me With your face in my window glow,178.1,184.76
"Wait for me, sweet widow It's okay to be in vain",188.59,211.44
"To me, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,",212.12,276.56

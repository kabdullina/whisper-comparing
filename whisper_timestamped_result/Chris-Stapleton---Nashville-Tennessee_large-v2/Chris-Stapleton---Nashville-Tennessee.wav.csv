I met you when I had a dream,24.49,27.19
Not so long ago it seems,28.09,30.53
We closed down a million bars,31.07,33.61
"Yeah, you and me, we've come so far",34.23,36.77
You showed me how to write a song,37.37,39.99
"We wrote some rite, we wrote some wrong",40.55,43.15
"I was down and out, you let me in",43.45,46.25
The time she was my only friend,46.81,49.59
So long nights we were in Tennessee,52.59,54.91
You can't have what's left of me,55.93,58.41
And as far as I can tell,59.07,61.21
That's how time I wish you were,62.21,64.71
"You built me up, you set me free",64.99,67.67
You tore down my memories,68.41,70.73
"So you be you, now be me",71.33,74.13
So long nights we were in Tennessee,74.77,77.01
Now you won't miss me when I'm gone,90.77,93.47
Your custom made for moving on,93.91,96.61
And time to time I'll pass you by,97.21,99.81
A face that I don't recognize,100.35,102.79
"And who knows, maybe it's from now",103.53,106.29
You'll be the one I think about,106.29,109.17
But I just can't imagine that,109.81,112.29
Cause I'm not one for looking back,112.91,115.57
So long nights we were in Tennessee,118.65,120.93
You can't have what's left of me,121.83,124.41
And as far as I can tell,124.99,127.21
That's how time I wish you were,128.21,130.59
"You built me up, you set me free",130.59,133.61
You tore down my memories,134.31,136.63
"So you be you, now be me",137.23,140.03
So long nights we were in Tennessee,140.61,142.85
So long nights we were in Tennessee,156.19,158.53
You can't have what's left of me,159.43,162.03
And as far as I can tell,162.65,164.79
That's how time I wish you were,165.75,168.27
"You built me up, you set me free",168.69,171.21
You tore down my memories,171.93,174.27
You're not who you used to be,175.03,177.55
So long nights we were in Tennessee,178.29,180.47

00:05.460 --> 00:07.480
Please snap them cross-line

00:08.020 --> 00:10.160
It looks like they're spinning the crime

00:10.380 --> 00:12.860
And ooh, it's your favorite side

00:13.280 --> 00:15.520
Tempted murder of my mind

00:15.660 --> 00:17.280
Can't even have a conversation

00:17.420 --> 00:18.380
Without you breaking

00:18.420 --> 00:20.000
Character tagging, going chasing

00:20.380 --> 00:22.260
Two faces don't be a cold thing

00:22.460 --> 00:23.730
Wherever you came from

00:23.730 --> 00:26.300
Before I let you get inside my brain

00:26.440 --> 00:29.140
And get in line, get in line

00:30.370 --> 00:31.910
And lie, lie, lie, lie

00:32.110 --> 00:34.430
You were not the first to try

00:34.590 --> 00:36.990
That I luck next time

00:37.310 --> 00:41.880
Party, but you couldn't put me

00:45.620 --> 00:59.530
You tried your act, you can't keep up

00:59.530 --> 01:00.690
Did you miss me bitch?

01:01.050 --> 01:02.030
Did you reminisce?

01:02.030 --> 01:03.670
Running my death certificate

01:04.310 --> 01:06.010
You almost got away with it

01:06.310 --> 01:07.340
But the rapist snits

01:07.340 --> 01:09.190
Now you got to admit to

01:09.590 --> 01:12.250
Your crimes, lie so, so slight

01:12.670 --> 01:13.770
Well, you're gonna be like

01:13.770 --> 01:15.030
Like, like, like, like

01:15.880 --> 01:16.930
Stopping so tight

01:16.930 --> 01:17.490
Yeah

01:17.790 --> 01:19.830
But you just had to decide to

01:20.030 --> 01:22.490
Get in line, get in line

01:23.890 --> 01:25.290
And lie, lie, lie, lie

01:25.430 --> 01:27.770
You were not the first to try

01:28.070 --> 01:30.370
That I luck next time

01:30.670 --> 01:35.060
Party, but you couldn't put me

01:35.060 --> 01:50.160
You tried your act, you can't keep up

01:50.260 --> 01:59.570
Your party, but you couldn't put me

02:03.050 --> 02:04.550
Back in the first step

02:04.630 --> 02:06.970
We sucked the shit that did this

02:07.010 --> 02:09.870
Exceed, talking up in toss and

02:09.910 --> 02:13.030
Welcome to live in that to me

02:13.310 --> 02:15.040
My life in the first step

02:15.040 --> 02:17.510
We sucked the shit that did this

02:17.510 --> 02:20.510
Exceed, talking up in toss and

02:20.610 --> 02:23.710
Welcome to live in that to me

02:24.030 --> 02:26.290
That's to me, that's to me

02:26.670 --> 02:29.140
That's to me, that's to me

02:29.140 --> 02:31.020
Party back

02:32.200 --> 02:34.560
Thought you could put me in a

02:34.600 --> 02:36.340
Party back

02:37.620 --> 02:40.220
You tried your best, but you would never

I see bad moon rising, trouble on the way.
There are wakes and lightning.
I see bad times today.
Don't go around tonight, but let's finally take your life.
There's a bad moon on the right.
I hear hurricanes blowing.
I know the end is coming soon.
I hear rivers overflowing.
I hear the voice of rain is growing.
Don't go around tonight, but let's finally take your life.
There's a bad moon on the right.
Oh, right.
Hope you got your things together.
Hope you got quite the bad day.
Looks like we're in for NASA weather.
One eye is taken before an eye.
Well, don't go around tonight, but it's time to take your life.

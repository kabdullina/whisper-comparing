1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,480
Please snap them cross-line

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,160
It looks like they're spinning the crime

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,860
And ooh, it's your favorite side

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,520
Tempted murder of my mind

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,280
Can't even have a conversation

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,380
Without you breaking

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,000
Character tagging, going chasing

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,260
Two faces don't be a cold thing

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,730
Wherever you came from

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,300
Before I let you get inside my brain

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,140
And get in line, get in line

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,910
And lie, lie, lie, lie

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,430
You were not the first to try

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,990
That I luck next time

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,880
Party, but you couldn't put me

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:59,530
You tried your act, you can't keep up

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,690
Did you miss me bitch?

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,030
Did you reminisce?

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,670
Running my death certificate

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,010
You almost got away with it

21
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,340
But the rapist snits

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,190
Now you got to admit to

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,250
Your crimes, lie so, so slight

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,770
Well, you're gonna be like

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,030
Like, like, like, like

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,930
Stopping so tight

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,490
Yeah

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,830
But you just had to decide to

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,490
Get in line, get in line

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,290
And lie, lie, lie, lie

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,770
You were not the first to try

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,370
That I luck next time

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,060
Party, but you couldn't put me

34
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:50,160
You tried your act, you can't keep up

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:59,570
Your party, but you couldn't put me

36
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,550
Back in the first step

37
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,970
We sucked the shit that did this

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,870
Exceed, talking up in toss and

39
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,030
Welcome to live in that to me

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,040
My life in the first step

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,510
We sucked the shit that did this

42
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,510
Exceed, talking up in toss and

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,710
Welcome to live in that to me

44
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,290
That's to me, that's to me

45
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,140
That's to me, that's to me

46
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,020
Party back

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,560
Thought you could put me in a

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,340
Party back

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,220
You tried your best, but you would never

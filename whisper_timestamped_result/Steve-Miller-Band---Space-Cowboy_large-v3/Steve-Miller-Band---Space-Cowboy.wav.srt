00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:24,200
I told you about living in the US of hate, don't you know that I'm a gangster of love?

2
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,630
Let me tell you people that I found a new way, and I'm tired of all this talk about love.

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,230
In the same old story, we were going to settle words about the good and the bad and the poor.

4
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:48,530
And the times keep on changing so I'm keeping on top of every fat gap who walks through my door.

5
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:06,510
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:39,490
I was born on this rock and I've been traveling through space since the moment I first realized

8
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,330
what all you fast-talking cats would do if you could. You know I'm ready for the final surprise.

9
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,390
There ain't no way around it, ain't nothing to say that's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside.

10
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,210
All the prayers and sobares keep the whole place uptight, love it keeps on getting darker outside.

11
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,330
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:21,150
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,710
I've seen your showdown, slowdowns, lost and found, turn around, support and on military shirts.

14
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,570
I keep my eyes on the prize on the long-thoughtened skies and I don't let my friends get hurt.

15
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:06,190
All you black-roofed schemers, power-tripped dreamers, better find something new to say.

16
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:14,190
Cause you're the same old story, it's the same old crime, you've got some heavy dudes to pay.

17
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:22,010
I'm a space cowboy, that you are ready for that.

18
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm a space cowboy, I'm sure you know where it's at, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

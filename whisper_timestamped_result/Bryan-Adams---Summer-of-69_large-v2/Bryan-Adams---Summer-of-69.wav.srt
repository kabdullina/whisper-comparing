1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,320
I got my first real sixth string

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,480
Boiled out the five and done

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,960
Played it till my fingers bled

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,860
Was a summer of 69

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,700
Me and some guys from school

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,340
Had a band and we tried real hard

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,720
Timmy quit, Jody got married

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,160
I should've known we never get far

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,420
Well, when I look back now

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,060
The summer seemed to last forever

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,500
And if I had the choice

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,480
Yeah, those won't all be there

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,460
Those were the birthdays of my life

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,830
Ain't no use in complaining

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,370
When you got a job to do

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,310
I spend my years down at the job in

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,770
And that's when I met you, yeah

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,590
Standing on your mama's porch

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
You told me that she waits for me

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:27,270
All the years, days of my life

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,830
Back in the summer of 69

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,930
When it was my new time

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,710
The times are changing

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,210
Look at everything that's coming down

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,950
Times went up when you got old sixth string

26
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,030
So you're back to wonder why it went wrong

27
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,350
Standing on your mama's porch

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
You told me that it was

29
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,250
Those were the best days of my life

30
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,570
Back in the summer of 69

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,630
69

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,110
Oh, yeah

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,620
What's that?

34
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,710
Nobody

35
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,130
I said who's that?

36
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,350
I said nobody

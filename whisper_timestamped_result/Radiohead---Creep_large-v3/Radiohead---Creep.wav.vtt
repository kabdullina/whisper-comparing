00:18.780 --> 00:25.400
When you were a fool, couldn't look you in the eye

00:28.920 --> 00:35.650
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry

00:39.050 --> 00:46.220
You float like a feather in a beautiful world

00:49.620 --> 00:56.690
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

00:59.990 --> 01:07.170
But I'm a creep, I'm a little

01:10.040 --> 01:18.030
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here

01:20.940 --> 01:22.600
I don't care if it hurts

01:26.150 --> 01:33.280
I wanna have control, I want a perfect body

01:36.650 --> 01:43.920
I want a perfect soul, I want you to notice

01:47.110 --> 01:54.450
What I'm not around, so fucking special

01:57.410 --> 01:59.690
I wish I was special

02:02.820 --> 02:09.980
But I'm a creep, I'm a little

02:12.960 --> 02:21.070
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here

02:29.850 --> 02:41.040
I don't belong here

03:05.270 --> 03:11.810
I don't belong here

03:14.930 --> 03:17.410
I don't belong here

03:20.790 --> 03:27.400
I don't belong here

03:35.940 --> 03:43.210
I don't belong here

03:46.830 --> 03:49.090
I don't belong here

03:49.090 --> 03:49.370
I don't belong here

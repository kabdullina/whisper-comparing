When you were a fool, couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special
But I'm a creep, I'm a little
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control, I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul, I want you to notice
What I'm not around, so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a little
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

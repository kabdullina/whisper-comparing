1
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,400
When you were a fool, couldn't look you in the eye

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,650
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry

3
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,220
You float like a feather in a beautiful world

4
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,690
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

5
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:07,170
But I'm a creep, I'm a little

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:18,030
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here

7
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,600
I don't care if it hurts

8
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,280
I wanna have control, I want a perfect body

9
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,920
I want a perfect soul, I want you to notice

10
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,450
What I'm not around, so fucking special

11
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,690
I wish I was special

12
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,980
But I'm a creep, I'm a little

13
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:21,070
What the hell am I to hear? I don't belong here

14
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:41,040
I don't belong here

15
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:11,810
I don't belong here

16
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,410
I don't belong here

17
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't belong here

18
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,210
I don't belong here

19
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,090
I don't belong here

20
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,370
I don't belong here

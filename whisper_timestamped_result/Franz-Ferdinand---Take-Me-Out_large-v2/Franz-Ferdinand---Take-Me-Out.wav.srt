1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,440
So if you're lonely

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,340
You know I'm here waiting for you

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,460
I'm just a crosshair

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,070
I'm just a shot away from you

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,350
And if you leave here

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,770
You leave me broken, shattered, and lie

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,970
I'm just a crosshair

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,690
I'm just a shot, then we can die

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,960
Even here, with you

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,170
Hey, don't you know you say you

11
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,650
I say, I say you don't show

12
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,050
Don't move, time is slow

13
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:55,550
I say, you say I say

14
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,230
Move this could die

15
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,630
I smooth this could die

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,710
I want you to take me out

17
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,960
I know I hope you're leaving here

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,440
Oh, I know I believe in him

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,350
I know I believe in him

20
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,290
With you

21
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,390
Hey, don't you know you say you

22
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,570
Don't know I say

23
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,270
In this could die

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,650
Take this could die

25
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,580
I want you to take me out

26
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,440
I move this could die

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,980
I smooth this could die

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,140
Come on

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,230
Believe in him

30
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,150
I know I hope you're leaving here

31
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,090
I know I believe in him

32
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,770
With you

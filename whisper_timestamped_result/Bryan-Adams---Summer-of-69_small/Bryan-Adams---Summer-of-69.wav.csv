I got my first real sixth string,5.08,7.32
Boiled out the five and done,8.14,10.48
Played it till my fingers bled,11.56,13.96
Was a summer of 69,14.82,16.86
Me and some guys from school,18.46,20.7
Had a band and we tried real hard,21.74,24.34
"Timmy quit, Jody got married",25.14,27.72
I should've known we never get far,28.5,31.16
"Well, when I look back now",32.74,34.42
The summer seemed to last forever,35.56,38.06
And if I had the choice,39.36,41.5
"Yeah, those won't all be there",42.74,45.48
Those were the birthdays of my life,46.22,49.46
Ain't no use in complaining,57.07,58.83
When you got a job to do,60.11,62.37
I spend my years down at the job in,63.13,66.31
"And that's when I met you, yeah",67.47,69.77
Standing on your mama's porch,70.37,72.59
You told me that she waits for me,73.68,76.2
"All the years, days of my life",77.44,87.27
Back in the summer of 69,92.59,94.83
When it was my new time,101.2,106.93
The times are changing,130.01,131.71
Look at everything that's coming down,132.57,135.21
Times went up when you got old sixth string,136.07,138.95
So you're back to wonder why it went wrong,139.45,142.03
Standing on your mama's porch,143.05,145.35
You told me that it was,146.46,147.86
Those were the best days of my life,157.03,160.25
Back in the summer of 69,165.49,167.57
69,174.55,174.63
"Oh, yeah",176.23,177.11
What's that?,204.24,204.62
Nobody,206.35,206.71
I said who's that?,207.23,209.13
I said nobody,209.41,210.35

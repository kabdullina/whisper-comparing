00:05.080 --> 00:07.320
I got my first real sixth string

00:08.140 --> 00:10.480
Boiled out the five and done

00:11.560 --> 00:13.960
Played it till my fingers bled

00:14.820 --> 00:16.860
Was a summer of 69

00:18.460 --> 00:20.700
Me and some guys from school

00:21.740 --> 00:24.340
Had a band and we tried real hard

00:25.140 --> 00:27.720
Timmy quit, Jody got married

00:28.500 --> 00:31.160
I should've known we never get far

00:32.740 --> 00:34.420
Well, when I look back now

00:35.560 --> 00:38.060
The summer seemed to last forever

00:39.360 --> 00:41.500
And if I had the choice

00:42.740 --> 00:45.480
Yeah, those won't all be there

00:46.220 --> 00:49.460
Those were the birthdays of my life

00:57.070 --> 00:58.830
Ain't no use in complaining

01:00.110 --> 01:02.370
When you got a job to do

01:03.130 --> 01:06.310
I spend my years down at the job in

01:07.470 --> 01:09.770
And that's when I met you, yeah

01:10.370 --> 01:12.590
Standing on your mama's porch

01:13.680 --> 01:16.200
You told me that she waits for me

01:17.440 --> 01:27.270
All the years, days of my life

01:32.590 --> 01:34.830
Back in the summer of 69

01:41.200 --> 01:46.930
When it was my new time

02:10.010 --> 02:11.710
The times are changing

02:12.570 --> 02:15.210
Look at everything that's coming down

02:16.070 --> 02:18.950
Times went up when you got old sixth string

02:19.450 --> 02:22.030
So you're back to wonder why it went wrong

02:23.050 --> 02:25.350
Standing on your mama's porch

02:26.460 --> 02:27.860
You told me that it was

02:37.030 --> 02:40.250
Those were the best days of my life

02:45.490 --> 02:47.570
Back in the summer of 69

02:54.550 --> 02:54.630
69

02:56.230 --> 02:57.110
Oh, yeah

03:24.240 --> 03:24.620
What's that?

03:26.350 --> 03:26.710
Nobody

03:27.230 --> 03:29.130
I said who's that?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.350
I said nobody

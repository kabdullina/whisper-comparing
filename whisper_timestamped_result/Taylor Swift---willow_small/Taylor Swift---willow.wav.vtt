00:12.130 --> 00:15.290
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

00:17.730 --> 00:21.130
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife

00:24.130 --> 00:26.170
And if it was an open shut case

00:27.010 --> 00:29.550
I never would've known from that look on your face

00:29.990 --> 00:33.230
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

00:35.510 --> 00:38.030
The more that you say, the less I know

00:38.450 --> 00:40.610
Wherever you stray, I follow

00:41.290 --> 00:43.870
I'm begging for you to take my hand

00:44.010 --> 00:46.770
Ripped my plans, that's my man

00:47.770 --> 00:51.010
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

00:53.530 --> 00:57.430
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in

00:59.840 --> 01:01.800
As if you were a mythical thing

01:02.780 --> 01:05.180
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring

01:05.600 --> 01:08.640
There was one prize I'd cheat to win

01:11.230 --> 01:13.730
The more that you say, the less I know

01:14.170 --> 01:16.570
Wherever you stray, I follow

01:16.730 --> 01:19.610
I'm begging for you to take my hand

01:19.970 --> 01:22.510
Ripped my plans, that's my man

01:22.690 --> 01:25.330
You know that my train could take you home

01:25.690 --> 01:27.730
Anywhere else is hollow

01:28.450 --> 01:31.050
I'm begging for you to take my hand

01:31.350 --> 01:34.050
Ripped my plans, that's my man

01:37.730 --> 01:41.290
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

01:43.800 --> 01:46.500
They count me out time and time again

01:49.140 --> 01:52.580
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

01:55.170 --> 01:58.210
I come back stronger than a 90's trend

01:59.170 --> 02:02.570
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark

02:04.860 --> 02:08.860
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

02:11.300 --> 02:13.320
Now this is an open shut case

02:14.160 --> 02:16.740
I guess I should have known from that look on your face

02:17.140 --> 02:20.560
Every bit and switch was a work of art

02:22.670 --> 02:25.250
The more that you say, the less I know

02:25.510 --> 02:27.630
Wherever you stray, I follow

02:28.420 --> 02:31.080
I'm begging for you to take my hand

02:31.420 --> 02:33.940
Ripped my plans, that's my man

02:34.380 --> 02:36.740
You know that my train could take you home

02:37.380 --> 02:39.420
Anywhere else is hollow

02:40.380 --> 02:42.500
I'm begging for you to take my hand

02:43.380 --> 02:45.400
Ripped my plans, that's my man

02:46.380 --> 02:48.120
The more that you say, the less I know

02:49.880 --> 02:53.920
I follow, begging for you to take my hand

02:54.280 --> 02:56.780
Ripped my plans, that's my man

02:57.020 --> 02:59.600
You know that my train could take you home

02:59.980 --> 03:02.280
Anywhere else is hollow

03:02.800 --> 03:05.360
I'm begging for you to take my hand

03:05.620 --> 03:08.360
Ripped my plans, that's my man

03:09.610 --> 03:11.090
Hey, that's my man

03:12.730 --> 03:13.850
That's my man

03:15.540 --> 03:16.680
That's my man

03:17.340 --> 03:19.780
Every bit and switch was a work of art

03:19.980 --> 03:21.200
That's my man

03:22.490 --> 03:23.970
Hey, that's my man

03:25.570 --> 03:28.210
I'm begging for you to take my hand

03:28.530 --> 03:31.290
Ripped my plans, that's my man

1
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,190
I met you when I had a dream

2
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,530
Not so long ago it seems

3
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,610
We closed down a million bars

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,770
Yeah, you and me, we've come so far

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,990
You showed me how to write a song

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,150
We wrote some rite, we wrote some wrong

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,250
I was down and out, you let me in

8
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,590
The time she was my only friend

9
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,910
So long nights we were in Tennessee

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,410
You can't have what's left of me

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,210
And as far as I can tell

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,710
That's how time I wish you were

13
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,670
You built me up, you set me free

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,730
You tore down my memories

15
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,130
So you be you, now be me

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,010
So long nights we were in Tennessee

17
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,470
Now you won't miss me when I'm gone

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,610
Your custom made for moving on

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,810
And time to time I'll pass you by

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,790
A face that I don't recognize

21
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,290
And who knows, maybe it's from now

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,170
You'll be the one I think about

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,290
But I just can't imagine that

24
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,570
Cause I'm not one for looking back

25
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,930
So long nights we were in Tennessee

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,410
You can't have what's left of me

27
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,210
And as far as I can tell

28
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,590
That's how time I wish you were

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,610
You built me up, you set me free

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,630
You tore down my memories

31
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,030
So you be you, now be me

32
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,850
So long nights we were in Tennessee

33
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,530
So long nights we were in Tennessee

34
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,030
You can't have what's left of me

35
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,790
And as far as I can tell

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,270
That's how time I wish you were

37
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,210
You built me up, you set me free

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,270
You tore down my memories

39
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,550
You're not who you used to be

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,470
So long nights we were in Tennessee

24490	27190	I met you when I had a dream
28090	30530	Not so long ago it seems
31070	33610	We closed down a million bars
34230	36770	Yeah, you and me, we've come so far
37370	39990	You showed me how to write a song
40550	43150	We wrote some rite, we wrote some wrong
43450	46250	I was down and out, you let me in
46810	49590	The time she was my only friend
52590	54910	So long nights we were in Tennessee
55930	58410	You can't have what's left of me
59070	61210	And as far as I can tell
62210	64710	That's how time I wish you were
64990	67670	You built me up, you set me free
68410	70730	You tore down my memories
71330	74130	So you be you, now be me
74770	77010	So long nights we were in Tennessee
90770	93470	Now you won't miss me when I'm gone
93910	96610	Your custom made for moving on
97210	99810	And time to time I'll pass you by
100350	102790	A face that I don't recognize
103530	106290	And who knows, maybe it's from now
106290	109170	You'll be the one I think about
109810	112290	But I just can't imagine that
112910	115570	Cause I'm not one for looking back
118650	120930	So long nights we were in Tennessee
121830	124410	You can't have what's left of me
124990	127210	And as far as I can tell
128210	130590	That's how time I wish you were
130590	133610	You built me up, you set me free
134310	136630	You tore down my memories
137230	140030	So you be you, now be me
140610	142850	So long nights we were in Tennessee
156190	158530	So long nights we were in Tennessee
159430	162030	You can't have what's left of me
162650	164790	And as far as I can tell
165750	168270	That's how time I wish you were
168690	171210	You built me up, you set me free
171930	174270	You tore down my memories
175030	177550	You're not who you used to be
178290	180470	So long nights we were in Tennessee

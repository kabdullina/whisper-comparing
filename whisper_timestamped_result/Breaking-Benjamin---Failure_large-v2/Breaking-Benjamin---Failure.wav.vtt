00:31.990 --> 00:34.670
Life will come our way

00:35.310 --> 00:37.770
It has only just begun

00:38.750 --> 00:41.010
The world will die a lot

00:41.840 --> 00:43.900
The fray will fall below

00:44.580 --> 00:47.120
Time will take our place

00:47.640 --> 00:50.280
We will turn it back to one

00:51.180 --> 00:53.480
The code for the code

00:54.240 --> 00:56.460
The long and long road

00:57.560 --> 01:01.600
Look for the light that leads me

01:03.180 --> 01:09.770
Tide of a temple

01:10.150 --> 01:11.730
A world down

01:12.370 --> 01:15.230
Temple of a world down

01:17.700 --> 01:19.680
Of salient

01:27.730 --> 01:30.070
Drive the crowd away

01:30.990 --> 01:33.690
We will fall from last to none

01:34.510 --> 01:36.870
The dark will fall with a tongue

01:37.590 --> 01:39.970
The world will carry on

01:40.930 --> 01:45.010
Look for the light that leads me

01:45.390 --> 01:48.930
Tide of feeling lost

01:52.780 --> 01:55.200
Temple of a world down

01:55.800 --> 01:58.360
Temple of a world down

01:59.020 --> 02:02.710
Of stint, red, tidied

02:05.220 --> 02:07.560
Temple of a world down

02:08.160 --> 02:11.020
Temple of a world down

02:13.450 --> 02:15.370
Of salient

02:36.050 --> 02:41.370
Tide of a world down

02:42.250 --> 02:44.770
Temple of a world down

02:45.410 --> 02:49.190
Tide of wasted red, tidied

02:51.420 --> 02:54.000
Temple of a world down

02:54.600 --> 02:56.690
Temple of a world down

02:56.690 --> 02:59.160
The value of sunlight

03:02.710 --> 03:19.190
Will fail, will fail

A premier of Rapist Rock,0.0,12.92
"entitled,",12.92,13.46
Life on a Million Canvas.,13.46,19.78
This song was recorded,19.78,28.1
Untouched sheets of clay,28.1,33.1
Her lay spread out before me,33.1,41.1
As her body once did,41.1,46.1
Though all five horizons,46.1,53.1
Revolved around my soul,54.1,59.1
I see her through the sun,59.1,62.1
Now the air I tasted and breathed,62.1,67.1
Has taken a turn,67.1,73.1
"Oh, and all I taught her was",73.1,80.1
Everything,80.1,85.1
"Oh, I know she gave me all",85.1,92.1
That she wore,92.1,98.1
And now my bitter hands,98.1,101.1
Shake beneath the clouds,101.1,104.1
Of what was everything,104.1,108.1
All the pictures sent,108.1,111.1
Of men washed in blood,111.1,114.1
Tattooed everything,114.1,119.1
I take a walk outside,119.1,124.1
I'm surrounded by,124.1,127.1
Some kids at play,127.1,131.1
I can feel their laughter,131.1,137.1
So why do I sing?,137.1,142.1
"Oh, and twisted thoughts",142.1,147.1
Have spun round my head,147.1,152.1
"I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning",152.1,157.1
Halfway the sun can drop away,157.1,166.1
And now my bitter hands,167.1,170.1
Cradle broken glass,170.1,173.1
Of what was everything,173.1,176.1
All the pictures sent,176.1,179.1
Of men washed in blood,179.1,182.1
Tattooed everything,182.1,185.1
All the love gone bad,185.1,189.1
Turned my world to black,189.1,192.1
Tattooed on high I see,192.1,195.1
All that I am,195.1,198.1
All I'll be,198.1,205.1
Yeah,205.1,208.1
Uh-huh,208.1,211.1
Uh-huh,211.1,214.1
Yeah,214.1,217.1
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,217.1,220.1
I know you'll be a star,220.1,223.1
Then somebody else's sky,223.1,226.1
"But why, why, why",226.1,232.1
"Can it be, oh, can it be",232.1,235.1
More?,235.1,242.1
Yeah,242.1,245.1
Uh-huh,245.1,248.1
Yeah,248.1,251.1
I'll be,251.1,254.1

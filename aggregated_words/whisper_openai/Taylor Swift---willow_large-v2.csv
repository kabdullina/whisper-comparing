I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,0.0,18.0
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife,18.0,24.28
And if it was an open shut case I never would have known from the look on,24.28,28.92
your face Lost in your current like a priceless wine,28.92,35.64
The more that you say the less I know Wherever you stray I follow,35.64,41.480000000000004
"Begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that's my man",41.480000000000004,47.84
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,47.84,53.56
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in,53.56,59.88
As if you were a mythical thing Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,59.88,65.56
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,65.56,71.32000000000001

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,109.24,115.08
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark,115.08,124.83999999999999
Show me the places where the others gave you scars,124.83999999999999,131.32
Now this is an open shut case I guess I should have known from the look on your face,131.32,137.07999999999998
Every bait and switch was a work of art,137.08,142.60000000000002

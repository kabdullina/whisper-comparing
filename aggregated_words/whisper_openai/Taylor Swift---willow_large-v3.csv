I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,0.0,15.6
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife,15.6,21.54
And if it was an open shut case,21.54,26.54
I never would've known from the look on your face,26.54,29.68
Lost in your current like a priceless wine,29.68,33.5
"The more that you say, the less I know",33.5,38.22
"Wherever you stray, I follow",38.22,41.0
Begging for you to take my hand,41.0,44.019999999999996
"Wreck my plans, that's my man",44.019999999999996,47.019999999999996
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,47.019999999999996,51.36
"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in",51.36,57.620000000000005
As if you were a mythical thing,59.68,62.68
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,62.68,65.52
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,65.52,71.2
"The more that you say, the less I know",71.2,74.08

"Wreck my plans, that's my man",79.92,82.64
You know that my train could take you home,82.64,85.62
Anywhere else is hollow,85.62,88.36
I'm begging for you to take my hand,88.36,89.5
"Wreck my plans, that's my man",89.68,90.68
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,90.68,91.68
They count me out time and time again,91.68,92.68
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,92.68,93.68
I've come back stronger than the 90s trend,93.68,94.56
Wait for you to do your job,94.56,95.56
I've got my heart built into a dream,95.56,96.56
Hold me tight but my heart's still out,96.56,97.56
I'm begging for you to take my hand,97.56,98.56
"Wreck my plans, that's my man",98.56,99.56
You know that my train could take you home,99.56,100.56

"Wreck my plans, that's my man",101.56,102.56
"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in",102.56,103.56
As if you were a mythical thing,103.56,104.56
I never would've known from the look on your face,104.56,105.56
Lost in your current like a priceless wine,105.56,106.56
"Rest in peace, baby, I know I'm a miracle",106.56,107.56
How are you feeling now?,107.56,108.58000000000001
My heart is beating fast,108.58000000000001,109.58000000000001
Was a willow and it bent right to your wind,109.58,112.88
But I've come back stronger than a 90s trend,112.88,118.5
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark,118.5,122.84
Show me the places where the others gave you scars,122.84,129.26
Now this is an open shut case,129.26,133.7
I guess I should've known from the look on your face,133.7,136.86
Every bait and switch was a work of art,136.86,140.8
"The more that you say, the less I know",140.8,145.34
"Wherever you stray, I follow",145.34,148.10000000000002

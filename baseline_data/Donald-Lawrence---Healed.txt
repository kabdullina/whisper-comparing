This is for everybody who's been restored
D. Lawrence coming at you.
Get up Come on you all
Let's sing this song
Got a story to tell you about some things that
I've been through but I'm healed oh
I'm healed had some ups and some downs leveled to the ground
But I'm healed oh I'm healed had to wrestle all night long wondering
What went wrong but I'm healed oh
I'm healed had some sunshine some rain heartache
And some pain I'm healed oh I'm healed
My God has touched me delivered he set my soul free my heart is mended
I'm hole again no chains are holding my got my liberty
I am healed I am healed I'm healed today
God touched me delivered he set my soul free my heart is mended
I'm hole again no chains are holding me got my liberty
I am healed I am healed I'm healed today
May have some scares I am healed circumstances
I'm still healed disappointments I am healed
May have some scares I am healed circumstances
I'm still healed disappointments I am healed
Oh oh oh I am healed I am healed I am healed with his stripes
I am healed oh oh oh I am healed I am healed
I am healed with his stripes I am healed
May have some scares I am healed circumstances
I'm still healed disappointments I am healed
May have some scares I am healed circumstances
I'm still healed disappointments I am healed

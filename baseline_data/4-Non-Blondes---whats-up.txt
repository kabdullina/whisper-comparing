Twentyfive years
And my life is still
Trying to get up that
Great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly
When I knew I should
That the world  was made up
Of this brotherhod of man
For what ever that means
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling
A little peculiar
And so I wake up
In the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath
And I get real high
And I scream from
The top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
I said hey,
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
I said hey,
What's going on?
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
And I try,
Oh my god do I try
I try all the time,
In this institution
And I pray,
Oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling
A little peculiar
And so I wake
In the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath
And I get real high
And I scream from
The top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
I said hey,
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
I said hey,
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
I said hey,
What's going on?
And I say, hey
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah
I said hey,
What's going on?
Uh, uh,  uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Twentyfive years

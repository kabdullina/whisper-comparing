You shout it loud, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Well, I am titanium
Well, I am titanium
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof glass
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
Well I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
Well I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
Well I am titanium

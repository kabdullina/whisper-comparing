It's a test of the ancient firebenders to keep the flame
Ein, zwei, drei, uno!
Oh is that what they’re calling it now?
Small town, big mouth
Well all I got is honesty
Hard working girls always come on to me
I guess I gotta go
See you when I’m back from Mexico
Don’t hate if you can’t relate
To this SVN/BVRNT stylee street parade
I don’t wanna be your man no more
I wanna make love to a whore
Ensenada
On my mind
And as the day is long
Something I can promise ya
That if I was the motherfucking president
I’d hire 20 strippers for my cabinet
Shotout bumouts need not apply
If you never hear another word you know the reason why
There’s something you should know
I declare you’re stoked
I don’t wanna be your man no more
I wanna make love to a whore
Ensenada
On my mind, whoa-oh
I don’t wanna be your man no more
I wanna make love to a whore
Ensenada
On my mind
Well I don’t wanna be your man no more
I wanna make love to a
Ensenada
On my mind
I don’t wanna be your man no more
No quiero sentir tu amor
Ensenada
En mi mente
There’s something you should know
I declare you’re stoked
There’s something you should know
I declare you’re stoked
There’s something you should know
I declare you’re stoked
There’s something you should know
I declare you so stoked haha

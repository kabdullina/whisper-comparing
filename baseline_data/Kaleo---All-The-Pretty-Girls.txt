All the pretty girls like Samuel
Oh, really doesn't share
Though it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair
Life is anything but fair
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
All the hidden love beneath
So won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Woo-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh
All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes a toll, my foolish pride
How long before I see the light?
I have waited, I have waited
For you to lay me down
Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard
Heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder
So won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Won't you lay...
Oh, won't you lay me
Oh, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me
Oh, won't you lay me down
Oh, won't you lay me
Say won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me down
Oh, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Yeah, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
For you to lay me
Won't you lay me down

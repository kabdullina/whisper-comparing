Came up to the surface
I cannot remember how long I've been swimming
Drowning
'Cause I've grown accustomed to all of the sharks
And they're not really breathing
Uh huh
Now I won't just mind the gap, I'll fill it
If I'm gonna eat this mosquito of anger
I haven't really made the most of this life
From here on I'll spit back whatever don't taste right
One time I told my heart to shut up
But I know that I can win back her trust
I owe at least that much to the both of us
Developed a knack for this dull conversation
I'd sharpen my wit, but what's my motivation?
Don't need to be clever to tell you that I'm just
A total mess and that I must throw that old self away
If I don't get right now
I will always
Eat what's decayed
Sleep with the snakes here in this cold grave
I haven't really made the most of this life
From here on I'll spit back whatever don't taste right
One time I told my heart to shut up
But I know that I can win back her trust
I owe at least that much to the both of us
I was waiting
(Waiting)
For this to happen to happen to me
But nothing's happening
I feel my skin as the sun burns in
And something in me says let it
'Cause one more look might change it all
One more word might change it all
One more try might change it all
One more kiss might change it all
One more look might change it all

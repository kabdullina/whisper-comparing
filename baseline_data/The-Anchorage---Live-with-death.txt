All right man
So how are we doing this?
So I know you don't like doing this that often
but we've been practicing a lot
I think we can do it live in one take
Live? One take Okay
we've been practicing like a lot
so yeah we can do it
Yeah one take
it's gonna take
Just once
All along I denied
And buried it beside
The decaying thoughts
Came crawling back inside
Maybe I never had a way
To keep it all at bay
One day I will fade away
We live with death
All around us
Life is best lived
When we embrace it
Now that I see the signs
Iâ€™ll keep it in my mind
Learn to thrive
And come alive
Without a doubt
I am outside of my grave
Until I fade away
We live with death
All around us
Life is best lived
When we embrace it
We live with death
All around us
Life is best lived
When we embrace it
Never gonna happen

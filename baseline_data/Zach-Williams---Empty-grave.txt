Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, I see an empty grave
Wipe away those tears, child
There's no need to cry
Stand up on your feet, now
Lift your head up high
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
To lay down your sorrow
Freedom is here today
Wipe away those tears, child
Put down your shame
Oh, I see an empty grave
I hear the heavens waking
Angels in jubilation
That stone's been rolled away
I feel the darkness breaking
I bet the devil's shaking
Somebody celebrate
I see an empty grave
Wipe away those tears, child
There's no need to cry
Stand up on your feet, now
Lift your head up high
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
To lay down your sorrow
Freedom is here today
Wipe away those tears, child
And put down your shame
Oh, I see an empty grave
I hear the heavens waking
Angels in jubilation
That stone's been rolled away
I feel the darkness breaking
I bet the devil's shaking
Somebody celebrate
I see an empty grave (ooh-ooh)
Wipe away those tears, child
Go and tell the news
What started in the garden
Was finished in the tomb
It's all reversed
The apple, the curse
Three days in the ground
Christ our Lord is risen
Death couldn't hold him down

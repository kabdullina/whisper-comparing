I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
It was the summer of sixty nine
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard.
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
It ain't no use in complaining
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive in
And that's when I met you, yeah
Standing on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
And when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah.
Back in the summer of sixty nine.
Man we were killing time
We were young and restless
Needed to unwind
I guess nothing could last forever, forever, no!
And now the times are changing
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong
Standing on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah.
Back in the summer of sixty nine, oh.
It was the summer of sixty nine, oh, yeah.
Sixty nine
